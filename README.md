# No Help Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a Tic Tac Toe game built with React and TypeScript, using Vite as a build tool. The game is built without the help of external libraries or Google, making it a great project for those looking to practice their coding skills.

## Getting Started
To get started, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

## How to play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns marking a square with either an "X" or an "O". The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
